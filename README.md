# üí¨ Tuiter Overview

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is it?

Tuiter is a social media platform where users can sign up, add friends, and express themselves through posts! Tuiter posts support text, pictures, and videos, and if you like someone else's post you can even Retuit it! If you Tuit something and then later regret it (which happens often on social media), you can delete it!

As a programmer new to website development, I made Tuiter to understand several of the many technologies that can be used to create a website. I created Tuiter to gain some practice in web development, and have a project that would allow me to explore some of the most commonly used tools in this sector of software engineering. This project showed me that I truly love web development, and one day I aspire to be a front-end engineer.

## üíª Technologies

Tuiter implements JavaScript and React to increase user-interaction, letting users post content and view profiles. It employs HTML for structure and CSS for colors, styling, and intuitive navigation through 9 user-friendly pages. It utilizes Bootstrap for layout and MongoDB to pull content from libraries and allow users to create Tuiter accounts. Lastly, it incorporates Redux to handle state management across the application.

TL;DR:

- JavaScript
- React
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- MongoDB
- Redux
